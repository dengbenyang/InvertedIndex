1	There is a place where the sidewalk ends
2	And before the street begins
3	And there the grass grows soft and white
4	And there the sun burns crimson bright
5	And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
6	To cool in the peppermint wind
7	Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
8	And the dark street winds and bends
9	Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
10	We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow
11	And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
12	To the place where the sidewalk ends
13	Yes we will walk with a walk that is measured and slow
14	And we will go where the chalk-white arrows go
15	For the children they mark and the children they know
16	The place where the sidewalk ends
